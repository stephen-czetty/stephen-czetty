## About me ##

Born an raised in New Jersey.  After graduating high school, I left for upstate New York to pursue my bachelor's
degree from [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://rpi.edu).  After taking a brief time off to work as an intern at
NASA's [Jet Propulsion Laboratories](https://jpl.nasa.gov) in California, I returned to RPI to earn my degree in computer science.

Soon after graduation, I packed up my few things and moved to Austin, Texas to start my professional career.  My career has crossed
various industries, including banking, legal, healthcare, and, most recently, financial services.  Over the years I have contributed to a number of
open-source projects and even have a couple of my own.  (Contributors are welcome, though it seems my work is filling a niche that only
I need!)

Thanks to my educational background, I find it takes me little time to learn a new concept or programming language.  My favorite method
is to dream up some project and write it in the new language.  The last time I did that, it was Python.  The next on my list is Go,
followed by Ruby.  I have plans to create a video series as I learn them.

I enjoy doing charity work, and volunteer my time and skills often.  I am especially passionate for child welfare and refugee support
organizations.  In fact, I sit on the board of a newly-formed child-welfare organization, The Warrior's Quiver.  It has yet to gain
it's legs (I haven't even turned on the website yet!) but I have high hopes for it to someday be a strong, effective organization.
